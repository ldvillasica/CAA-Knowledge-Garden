## Abstract
Poultry are vulnerable to various parasitic diseases, with ectoparasite infestations being one of its major problems. *Lipeurus caponis*, an ectoparasite in chicken, is a primary concern due to their detrimental impact on the health and productivity of birds. This study examined the active compounds present in neem leaf extract (NLE) and evaluated its efficacy against poultry wing lice infestations using an adult immersion test. This study revealed that the phytochemical components of NLE present in NLE were flavonoids (+++), steroids(+++), tannins (+++), alkaloids (+) and tannins (+). Different concentrations of NLE (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%), distilled water, and cypermethrin were used in this study. Mortality was recorded after 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 and 24 hours. The result showed that cypermethrin (97.78%) has the highest mortality rate. However, 100% NLE concentration (86.67%) was observed to have the highest mortality rate among treatments with NLE concentration. A significant difference (p = < 0.0001) was also observed among treatment means in mortality rate and different time intervals. Furthermore, cypermethrin and a 100% concentration of NLE have comparable effects against poultry wing lice. A 100% concentration of NLE can be used as a natural alternative insecticide for poultry wing lice.
