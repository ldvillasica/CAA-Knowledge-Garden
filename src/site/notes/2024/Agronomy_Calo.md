## Abstract
This study investigates the response of yellow corn (Zea mays L.) to various in-row plant spacings when intercropped with mung bean (Vigna radiata L.), focusing on growth, yield performance, and profitability. Conducted at Caraga State University from February to May 2024, the experiment utilized a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four treatments replicated three times. Treatments included corn alone and corn intercropped with mung bean at 75 cm, 100 cm, and 150 cm spacings. Initial soil samples were analyzed for pH, organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, and exchangeable potassium. Corn varieties NK6410 BGT and Green Gram mung bean were used, with appropriate fertilizer applications and pest management strategies implemented. Results indicated that intercropping corn with mung bean improved overall land use efficiency and resource utilization compared to monocropping. The study found that the appropriate in-row spacing of yellow corn significantly affected both yellow corn and mung bean growth and yield. The 75-cm spacing demonstrated the highest yield performance and profitability, optimizing the benefits of nitrogen fixation from mung beans and the efficient use of soil nutrients. Harvesting was conducted at 75 days for corn and 45â€“75 days for mung beans. This research highlights the potential of intercropping systems to enhance crop productivity and profitability, particularly in regions with limited resources. It underscores the importance of adopting sustainable agricultural practices such as corn and mung bean intercropping security soil health, and environmental sustainability
