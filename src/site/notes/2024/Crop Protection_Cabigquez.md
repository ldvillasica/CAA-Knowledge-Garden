## Abstract
Rice, a vital food staple, sustains billions worldwide and holds deep economic and cultural significance. However, its cultivation faces significant challenges, including threats from pests, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes like *Meloidogyne graminicola*. These nematodes can cause severe yield losses and hinder sustainable rice production. Addressing this menace is essential to safeguard global food security and the livelihoods of millions. Developing effective management strategies against nematode infestations is critical this study was conducted with the following objectives: 1) to identify plant parasitic nematode genera through morphology associated with rice that commonly grown in Agusan del Norte and 2) to determine their occurrence and distribution. Soil samples were collected from (5) selected areas planted with rice (P-2c Lower Tiniwisan Butuan City, Barangay, Panaytayon P-1 RTR, Barangay., Sanghan P-5 Cabadbaran City, Barangay, Taod-oy P-3 Magallanes, and Barangay 1 Buenavista). The results showed that six (6) genera of plant parasitic nematodes were identified in rice soils. These were *Paratylenchus sp*. *Meloidogyne sp*., *Tylenchus sp*. *Helicotylenchus sp*. and *Trichodorus sp*. *Heterodera sp*. *Paratylenchus* had the highest mean population density followed by *Trichodorus sp*. The other nematode genera had low mean population density, Regardless of the area , the population of *Pratylenchus sp* was highest, followed by *Trichodorus sp*. The genus *Paratylenchus sp*. (59.66%) had the highest percent occurrence, followed by *Trichodorus spp*. (38.68%), but the genus *Paratylenchus sp*., *Meloidogyne sp*., *Trichodorus spp*., had the highest percent distribution. Many genera of plant parasitic nematodes were associated with rice in this study, including the potentially damaging nematodes of significance to rice in selected areas of Agusan del Norte. Identifying and understanding them is crucial for effective management.
