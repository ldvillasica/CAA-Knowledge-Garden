## Abstract
<p align="justify">The study was conducted to evaluate the growth and yield performance of kangkong using different organic nutrient solutions grown in hydroponic systems. The experiment was laid out in a complete randomized design (CRD) with five (5) treatments that were arranged at random. The treatments were designated as; T0 (Water), T1 (SNAP), T2 (Kuhol Amino Acid), T3 (Fish Amino Acid), and T4 (Vermitea + Fermented Plant Juice). The results were analyzed using ANOVA and Least Significant Difference (LSD) in the STAR Program. The highest yield was observed in plants applied with Treatment 1 and the same treatment showed an excellent effect in terms of plant height, stem diameter, number of shoots, number of leaves, leaf width, leaf length, color of leaves, shoot weight, and root weight. In terms of root length, T3 obtained the longest roots. In conclusion, the organic treatments that were used in the study did not have a notable, significant effect on growth and yield performance as compared to T1. However, FAA can be used as an alternative to the synthetically formulated SNAP solution as the result showed that it performed next to T1 and had exhibited the highest value in almost all parameters among all organic treatments.</p>
