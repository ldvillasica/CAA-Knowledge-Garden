## Abstract
<p align="justify">Large ruminant production in the Philippines plays a vital role in contributing to economic sustainability. However, poor management and low quality of forage during dry seasons result in declining production. Thus, the need to assess feed sources and management practices. This study's results showed that most of the large ruminants raised by farmers were cattle used for fattening production. In addition, the large ruminants are usually acquired from the local community. Housing facilities such as roof and floor materials were not provided. Thus, large ruminants can survive in any climatic condition. Moreover, Carabao grass was the common forage given to the large ruminants. However, Napier, Cogon grass, Kans grass, Mulato II, Mombasa grass, Madre de agua, and para grass were also given to the animals. Most of the respondents did not provide concentrate, silage, hay, and urea-molasses-mineral block. However, vitamin B complex and dewormer were given. When examining the quality of the feeds given to the animals, the respondent only relies on their experience. Furthermore, lack of forages during the dry season was a common problem experienced by the raiser. Most of the raisers suggested that improvement in feeding management was needed to improve the production of ruminant animals. Subsequently, among the common forage given to the large ruminant, Madre de agua has the highest crude protein (18.21%) and ash content (21.80%). Meanwhile, Mulato II (15%), Napier grass (3.18%), and Cogon grass (37.1%) have the highest moisture content, crude fat, and crude fiber, respectively.</p>
