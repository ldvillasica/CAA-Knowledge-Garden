## Abstract
Nitrogen is an essential nutrient for rice growth and metabolism. Planting distance is an important aspect of production in the transplanting method of agriculture since it impacts productivity. Therefore, it was imperative to find out the right nitrogen rate that will improve the performance of NSIC Rc 160 lowland rice and at the same time determine which planting distance utilizes nitrogen efficiently. Hence, this study was conducted to evaluate their effects on the growth and yield of this lowland rice. Two planting distances were used as mainplots: M1 - 15×15 cm, M2 - 20×20 cm with four different subplots; S0 - Control, S1 - 60 kg N ha-1, S2 - 90 kg N ha-1, and S3 - 120 kg N ha-1. This study was laid out in a split-plot arranged in RCBD with three replications. Study revealed that the growth and yield components of rice (NSIC Rc 160) was greatly influenced by the planting distance of 20×20 (M2) paired with nitrogen rate of 120 kg N ha-1 (S3) in terms of the plant height at 60 to 75 DAT, productive tillers, panicle length, number of panicles per tiller and also for the weight of grains per panicle. Additionally, higher grain yield of rice were attained at a favorable planting distance of 15×15 (M1) paired with a nitrogen rate of 120 kg N ha-1 (S3). Moreover, highest percent nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and return on investment (ROI) were attained when rice was planted at a planting distance of 15×15 (M1) paired with the nitrogen rate of 90 kg N ha-1 (S2).
