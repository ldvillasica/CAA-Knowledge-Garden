# INFLUENCE OF PACKAGING MATERIALS ON THE POSTHARVEST QUALITY AND SHELF-LIFE OF BITTER GOURD (***Momordica charantia*** VAR. GALAXY MAX F1) STORED UNDER AMBIENT CONDITION

## Abstract
Bitter gourd, also known as *Momordica charantia*, is a tropical vine that belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family. Due to its high perishability and susceptibility to senescence, bitter gourds can exhibit early indicators of softening, yellowing, and weight loss. This study was conducted to evaluate the postharvest quality and shelf life of bitter gourd, investigate the chemical characteristics and evaluate the effects of bitter gourd as influenced by different packaging materials under ambient condition. The experiment was laid out in a Complete Randomized Design (CRD) with ten samples per treatment and replicated three times. Bitter gourd were packed with the following treatments; T0 – No packaging, T1 – Polypropylene (8x14” in size, 0.003mm thick), T2 – Polyethylene (8x14” in size, 0.003mm thick), T3 – Low Density Polyethylene Cling wrap (0.002mm thick), T4 – Low Density Polyethylene Ziplock (8x14” in size, 0.003mm thick) then stored for 8 days. The packed samples exhibited significant differences from unpacked sample in retaining quality parameters such as physical weight loss, Visual Quality Rating, Shelf life, Yellowing index, Total Soluble Solids, pH, TA and Vit. C. All samples that are packed showed notably lower weight loss compared to the control, while yellowing index was higher in the unpacked samples. TSS and pH increased during storage, but packed samples maintained lower levels compared to unpacked samples. TA and Vit. C decreased significantly during storage, with the control sample exhibiting the lowest TA and Vit.C among treated samples. Results revealed that different packaging materials significantly affected the physical and chemical characteristics, postharvest quality, and shelf life of bitter gourd. Bitter gourd packed in LDPE Ziplock significantly reduced weight loss, prolonged visual quality and shelf life, and delayed color changes or yellowing after 8 days of storage.
