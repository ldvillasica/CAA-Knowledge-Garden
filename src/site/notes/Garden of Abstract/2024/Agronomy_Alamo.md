# GROWTH AND YIELD RESPONSE OF SWEETPOTATO (***Ipomoea batatas*** L. LAM) TO THE TIMING AND RATES OF NPK APPLICATION
*MICHELLE C. ALAMO*
Major: Agronomy #agron
## Abstract
Sweetpotato yields have a potential increase with appropriate and effective crop management practices including timing and rates of NPK fertilization. The study was conducted from January to May 2024. Thus, this study aimed to determine the effects of timing and rates of NPK application on the agronomic characteristics, yield component and economic profitability of Sweetpotato NSIC Sp25. The experiment was arranged in RCBD with four treatments and three replicates. Four treatments were designated as T1 (Control), T2 (40-40-60 kg ha-1 of N, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>O at 1 WAP), T3 (40-40-60 kg ha-1 of N, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> & K<sub>2</sub>O at 1 MAP), T4 (20-20-30kg ha1 of N, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> & K<sub>2</sub>O at 1 WAP and 20-20-30kg ha1 of N, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> & K<sub>2</sub>O at 1 MAP. Based on the results of the study, the most effective treatment for optimizing the growth and yield of the NSIC Sp25 sweetpotato variety was the split application of 20- 20-30 kg ha-1 of NPK at 1 WAT and 1 MAP and T4 with the full dose of 40-40-60 kg/ha at 1 MAP. This treatment resulted in terms of agronomic characteristics; number of primary lateral vines, length of main vine as well as on the yield components; weight of marketable roots and total root yield.
