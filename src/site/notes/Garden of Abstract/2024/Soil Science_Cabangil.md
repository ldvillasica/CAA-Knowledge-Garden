## Abstract
In recent years, the use of biological control as an alternative method for disease management has significantly expanded. One notable approach involves the utilization of T. harzianum fungi which are increasingly recognized in agriculture for their exceptional capabilities as antagonists against a broad spectrum of plant pathogens, serving as valuable contributors to biological disease management strategies. This study aims to determine the best biochar carrier for T. harzianum at different rates (2%, 4, and 6%), assess the survival and viability, and evaluate the chemical properties of the media. The experiment was laid out in a Complete Randomized Design (CRD) with a dual factor having thirteen treatments with three replications. The treatments were composed of four types of biochar. The results showed that biochar application significantly enhances the chemical properties and nutrient composition of the media such as pH, Electrical Conductivity, Total Phosphorus (P), and Total Potassium (K) which were observed in Coco Coir (CCC) biochar at a 6% application rate. Meanwhile, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Total Nitrogen (N) have comparable results in the analysis. The highest colony forming unit (CFU) counts and survival were observed in Coco Shell Market (CSH M) at 6%, Coco Coir (CCC) at a 2% rate, Coco Shell Market (CSH M) at a 4% rate, and Coco Coir (CCC) at a 6% rate in 30, 60, 90, and 120 days, respectively. Overall, the increasing rates of biochar are an optimized level as the best carrier for T. harzianum and enhanced chemical properties.
