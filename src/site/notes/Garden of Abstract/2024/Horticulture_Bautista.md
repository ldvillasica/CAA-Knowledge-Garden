# EFFECTS OF TRANSPORT PACKAGING MATERIALS ON THE POST HARVEST QUALITY AND SHELF LIFE OF CHAYOTE (***Sechium edule*** var. Virens levis)

## Abstract
Chayote (*Sechium edule*) is popularly known as “sayote” in the Philippines. Chayote is mainly grown in cool mountainous regions of the Philippines. According to the locals in Barangay Mat-i, Claveria, Misamis Oriental, particularly at Empleo Farm where Chayote samples were obtained, the produce is sold to brokers from Surigao City, Bayugan City, Butuan City, and Cagayan de Oro. Thus, transporting Chayote from the production site to the marketplace takes many hours, presenting challenges. Gallardo, (2019) noted that farmers in Brgy. Mat-i pack the newly-harvested Chayote into sacks, while exceeding the sack’s capacity using a plastic twine. However, using sacks beyond their capacity, especially for long-distance transport, can lead to damages such as bruising and cuts, highlighting issues with the chosen packaging material. The post-harvest quality and shelf life of perishable agricultural produce, such as chayote, heavily relies on appropriate handling and transportation practices posing a challenge for post-harvest management. This study aimed to determine how different packaging materials impact the post-harvest quality and shelf life of chayote. Chayote were transported from Mat-i, Claveria, Misamis Oriental to Postharvest Laboratory of the College of Agriculture and Agri-Industries, Caraga State University, Ampayon, Butuan City. The treatments included Polysack bags (T0), Plastic Crates (T1), Wooden crates (T2), Net Bags (T3), and Polyethylene Bags (T4). Observations over 21 days in the laboratory revealed that plastic crates exhibited promising results compared to other packaging materials. The study found significantly higher damages for chayote packed in polysack bags compared to those in plastic crates, with the latter demonstrating superior shelf life extension and visual quality preservation. Plastic crates effectively reduced transportation damage and maintained the freshness and attractiveness of chayote throughout a duration of four (4) hours of transit, covering a distance of 124 kilometers (km). Lack of proper ventilation, rigidity, and durability were identified as primary causes of postharvest losses.
