## Abstract
The poultry industry is vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which is associated with various climatic hazards that hamper the productivity of the chickens. This study assesses the vulnerability of Basilan chicken of the five Barangay to various climatic hazards (flood, drought, typhoon, changes in rainfall pattern, and pests & diseases). A survey was conducted in Bayugan City in Barangay Salvacion, Saguma, Maygatasan, Bucac, and Marcelina. The respondents are selected based on snowball samplng who are raisers of Basilan chicken with a minimum of 10 heads for at least 5 years of raising. This study uses the VAST agro tool, a quick participatory approach to assess the vulnerability. The results found that all Barangay experienced these hazards over the past decade, however, exposure levels ranged from very rare to moderate. Pests and diseases emerged as the most significant threat. Barangay with diversified income sources displayed a better adaptive capacity compared to those reliant on agriculture. Furthermore, the vulnerability index identified Saguma and Maygatasan as highly adaptive, while Bucac and Marcelina were moderately vulnerable to climatic hazards. These findings can guide local policymakers in developing adaptation strategies for climatic hazards, awareness campaigns, and support systems among Basilan raisers.
