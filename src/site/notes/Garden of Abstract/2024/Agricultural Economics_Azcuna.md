## Abstract
The supply chain of citronella and lemongrass in the Caraga Region was documented to determine the key actors and their critical functions and to identify the issues along the chain. Systematic review of published articles, key informant interviews, and a survey of 48 citronella farmers, 3 processors of citronella, 6 farmers of lemongrass, and 2 processors of lemongrass were used to obtain information about the said chain for the development of the lemongrass and citronella industry. The results of the study revealed only limited and outdated published articles of these commodities. The supply chain of citronella and lemongrass were having issues about the lack of buyer, problems about storage and processing facilities, and lack of government agency that focuses on market linkage. This study suggests that the government must give attention and support to the farmers and processors in the industry in terms of capability-building and logistics support programs to empower the farmers and the processors for Caraga Region to exploit the potentials of lemongrass and citronella.
